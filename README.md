# Mapping Utilities [Godot-C#]
## Work in progress.
### What is this?
Mapping Utilities is a Godot C# library for automatic shape generation based on coordinates of a XY plane.
This tool is intended to make the logical creation and representation of regular and irregular bodies much easier. 
### What does this do?
With Mapping Utilities we can simulate, for instance: forests, rivers, roads, dungeons, cities, etc, and print them
in a bidimensional plane.
### What does this NOT do? (As for now)
Mapping Utilities cannot simulate depth or elevation, as it lacks of a third dimension to work with. 
In other words: It outputs a XY plane (2D), not a XYZ plane (3D).
So, for example, given the case of creating a mountain, It is possible to generate Its boundaries, but not the progressive height from Its feet to the summit.
